
The Signedness Checker guarantees that signed and unsigned integral values are not mixed together in a computation.Signedness is primarily about how the bits of the representation are interpreted, not about the values that it can represent.
I have done case study on some classes and seen that signedness checker is weak and some improvement can be done I have done in java.util.array ,java.nio.file.Files and java.lang.Integer and may be some more classes and Will further analyze this checker where it needs more enhancements.
